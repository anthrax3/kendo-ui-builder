# Blank View

Blank views are views which allow you to create your own custom view by dragging and dropping rows and columns to create a layout and then adding functional components to it.

The Blank view template supports a variety of components for you to define a view instance, including layout (rows and columns), data management (e.g., editable Grid), editor (e.g., Text Box), scheduling (e.g., Calendar), navigation (e.g., Toolbar), and custom HTML components. With these components you can implement a wide variety of view instances with a look and feel limited only by the components that you include and the layouts you specify.

The Blank view also allows you to specify multiple data source instances per view instance. These data source instances can be bound to different content components, often with the use of corresponding models that represent data items (records in the data source). However, the display and update of data in a view instance requires additional programming, depending on the components you include in the view and how their data bindings are implemented. This programming is aided by generated view factory and template (custom section) files, as well as a helper class for accessing data sources used in the view.
