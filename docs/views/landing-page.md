# Landing Page View

The Landing Page view is one of the built-in system views which the [Application Module]({% slug appmodule_kuib %}) provides by default.

The Landing Page view:

* Represents the layout of the web page that will load when the user clicks on a search engine optimized search result or an online advertisement.
* Lists all modules inside its content.  
* Allows you to modify some of its properties. For more information on which properties of the Landing Page view are subject to modification, refer to the right-hand vertical toolbar (property grid) of the view.
