# App Layout View

The App Layout view is one of the built-in system views which are delivered by the default Application Module.

The App Layout view:

* Provides the layout of the whole application.
* Serves as a placeholder for all application views by allowing you to embed the other views inside its content.
* Has a similar functional status as the Blank view because it supports the dragging and dropping of columns and rows and of specific navigation components.
