# Predefined Views

### Data-Grid

Data-Grid views represent read-only, table-like displays of the information in the data source. The data source itself determines the organization and display type of the data.

For more information, refer to the tutorial on [adding and editing Data-Grid views]({% slug editblankviews_tutorials_kuib %}).

### Data-Grid-Form

Data-Grid-Form views are split screens featuring a Data-Grid view and a form display showing the information in a selected row. This view can be read-only or user-editable. If editing is enabled, users edit information in the form display.

For more information, refer to the tutorial on [adding and editing Data-Grid-Form views]({% slug editblankviews_tutorials_kuib %}).

### Data-Grid-Separate-Form

Data-Grid-Separate-Form views are similar to the Data-Grid-Form. However, they render only the Data-Grid view unless users select a row. The information from that row is then shown as a form display on a separate screen. If editing is enabled, the screen switches to a form display suitable for editing.
