# Hierarchical Data Grid View

The Hierarchical Data Grid view is one of the built-in views that are provided by the Builder for facilitating common use-case scenarios.  

## Features

* Represents a Grid component with child grids. The child grids become visible when the users expand a row of the parent Grid.
* Supports CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) data operations.
* Supports editing for the child grids through the **Read-Only**, **Incell**, **Inline**, and **Popup** modes.
* Supports error handling.
* Allows you to set and edit its basic functionalities. For more information on the settings that are subject to modification, refer to the right-hand vertical toolbar (property grid) of the view.
* Through the **Settings** menu against each view in the view panel, you can edit the root properties of the view, as well as duplicate, move, and delete the view.

> In order for the Hierarchical Data Grid view to work properly, relate the data sources to which you bind the parent and the child grids. Otherwise, the child grids will not render the data. For more information, refer to the articles on [data providers]({% slug dataprovidersoverview_kuib %}).
