# Kendo UI Builder: Documentation

This is the repository containing the documentation for the Kendo UI Builder and describing it as a product for integration to applications other than OpenEdge.

While the information draws from the content published on the [Progress<sup>Â®</sup> Software Documentation web site](https://documentation.progress.com/index.html#page/progdocindex/kendo-ui-builder-by-progress.html), it is a separate chunk of information intended to be published on the Telerik web site and will refer to the integration of Kendo UI Builder (KUIB) with applications other than the OpenEdge business ones.

Currently, this repository is:
* A temporary documentation hub.
* A work-in-progress (WIP) project.

The beta release of the KUIB documentation on the Telerik web site is planned for March 2017. The final release is intended for June 2017.

Should you have any comments:
* On the documentation, feel free to contact Desislava Mihaylova.
* On KUIB features, feel free to contact Svetlozar Angelov.
