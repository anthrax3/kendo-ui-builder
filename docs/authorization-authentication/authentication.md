# Authorization and Roles

The Builder allows you to define specific roles to the application and set authorization rights to its modules, views, and rows and columns of the Blank view.

At runtime, you can use the login procedure for sending the list of the available roles and the server for marking the valid ones for the particular user.

> Defining user roles and setting access rights hides parts of the user interface. As a result, make sure that the Data Service does not send any data over the wire for which the user is not authorized to see.
