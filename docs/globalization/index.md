# Globalization Overview

Globalization is a process which combines the translation of component messages and the usage of specific culture locales.

By default, the Builder sets US-style date, time, and number format to the generated application. You can change the default culture and enable the application to update its locale parameters by utilizing .... the date, time, currency and number formats.

During the build process, the application creates a default localization file for the default culture formats. To provide support for other cultures, copy the default file and edit its culture and messages. The application displays all locales in a drop-down list in its header at runtime.

The Kendo UI Builder supports the globalization practices and approaches that are implemented in the Kendo UI components for Angular and for AngularJS.
