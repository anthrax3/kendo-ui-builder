# Right-to-Left Support

Right-to-Left (RTL) support represents the ability of an application to render its content from right to left in specific languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, or Japanese.

In web applications, the RTL mode can be enabled with the `dir` attribute of a DOM element. To enable the RTL mode for all Kendo UI components in your Angular application, provide a text direction value by using the [RTL]({% slug api_l10n_rtl %}) token in the root module of the application. You can also limit the RTL mode to a part of the application by providing the token to a sub-module. By default, the RTL mode is disabled.

For the list of the Kendo UI for Angular components which provide RTL options, refer to the article on [globalization support]({% slug l10nsupport_l10n %}).
