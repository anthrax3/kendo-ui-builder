# Kendo UI Builder Overview

Kendo UI Builder is an application that creates web-based user interfaces (UIs).

For more information on how to integrate the Kendo UI<sup>®</sup> Builder by Progress<sup>®</sup> (Kendo UI Builder) into OpenEdge business applications, refer to the [Progress<sup>®</sup> Software Documentation web site](https://documentation.progress.com/index.html#page/progdocindex/kendo-ui-builder-by-progress.html).  

## Overview

The UIs that are created by the Kendo UI Builder are specifically used to revamp existing business applications so that they support the implementation of the Kendo UI components. Practically, by using the Kendo UI Builder you separate the UI from the business logic that runs on the application server. The tooling shipped by the Builder delivers responsive web UIs as deployable web applications and supports future UI upgrades of the initial web application by using customizable templates and metadata from which the deployable web application is generated.
