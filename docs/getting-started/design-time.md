## Managing App Level Operations

Once the application is created, the Builder loads the **App Design** page.

### Deployment

The **App Design** page provides the UI for generating, reviewing, and publishing your application. For more information, refer to the article on [bundling and packaging]({% slug bundlepackage_kuib %}).

### Modules

By default, the **App Design** page provides the built-in App Module which contains the Login and the App Layout views. For more information, refer to the articles on [modules]({% slug modulesoverview_kuib %}) and [views]({% slug viewsoverview_kuib %}).

From the **App Design** page you can:

* Add a new module by clicking **Add Module**.
* Change the order of the modules by dragging and dropping them within the list. The order of the modules on this page corresponds to the order in which they will be rendered by the application at runtime.
* Edit the user-defined module properties, delete a module or its views by using the **Gear** menu on the module card.
* Add or edit views in a module by clicking its card.

## Data Providers

The **App Design** page provides the options to define the settings for the data providers on root level. For more information, refer to the article on [data providers]({% slug dataprovidersoverview_kuib %}).

From the **App Design** page you can:

* Add a data provider by clicking **Add Data Provider**.
* Edit the properties or delete a data provider by using the **Gear** drop-down options list of the card.
* Add or edit a data source by using the **Gear** drop-down options list of the card.
