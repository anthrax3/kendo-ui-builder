# Designing the Application

## App Design Page

Once the application is created, the Builder loads the initial **App Design** application page which allows you to set the generic operations and units of the application.

### Modules Section

The **App Design** page displays the default, built-in App Module, which contains the Login and the App Layout views. For more information, refer to the articles on [modules]() and [views]().

> The App Module cannot be deleted.

* To add a new module, click **Add Module**.
* To change the order of the modules, drag and drop them within the list. The order of the modules on this page corresponds to the order in which they will be rendered by the application at runtime.
* To edit the user-defined module properties, delete a module or its views, use the **Gear** menu on the module card.
* To add or edit views in a module, click its card.

## Data Providers Section

* To add a Data Provider, click **Add Data Provider**. Once added, the **App Design** page displays its card.
* To edit the properties or delete a Data Provider, use the **Gear** drop-down options list.
* To add or edit a Data Source, use the card **Gear** drop-down options list.
