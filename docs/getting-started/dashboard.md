# Kendo UI Builder Dashboard

The dashboard of the Kendo UI Builder stores all your created, imported, and migrated projects.

## Initial Load

When you load the Builder for the first time and you have no current projects yet, the Dashboard renders only the UI with the selectable options to create or import an application.

<!-- screen -->

## Cards

Once you create, import, or migrate an application, the Dashboard stores the project and displays a card for it. Depending on the status of each application, the Dashboard adds a tag to the card which indicates what further actions are required for the successful integration of the project.
