# Dashboard

When you start the Builder, its initial Dashboard page appears.

The Dashboard is the user interface that assists you when creating the application and setting its properties. It also stores the cards of all your previously created, imported, and migrated projects.

## Initial Load

If you load the Builder for the first time and you have no current projects yet, the Dashboard provides options to create or import an application. For more information on creating new projects, refer to the article on [designing the application]({% slug designingtheapp_kuib %}).

// screen

## Cards and Tags

Once you create or import an application, the Dashboard displays a status card for the project and stores it.

If you already have projects from previous releases or if you import external applications, the Dashboard compares the versions of the application metadata and of the metadata which the Builder supports, and attempts to import the projects. Depending on the result from the metadata comparison, the Dashboard adds a tag per card which reflects the current status of the project. For more information, refer to the article on [migration]({% slug migration_kuib %}).

## Log Messages

The **Output** bar displays the log messages which are intended to facilitate the debugging or troubleshooting processes. For more information, refer to the articles on [debugging]({% slug debugging_kuib %}) and [troubleshooting]({% slug troubleshooting_kuib %}).
