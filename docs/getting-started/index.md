# Getting Started with Kendo UI Builder

To start using Kendo UI® Builder by Progress® to build Angular web applications, provide the [prerequisites](#toc-prerequisites) and follow the [installation process](#toc-installation).  

The UIs that are created by the Kendo UI Builder are specifically used to revamp existing business applications so that they support the implementation of the Kendo UI components. Practically, by using the Kendo UI Builder you separate the UI from the business logic that runs on the application server. The tooling shipped by the Builder delivers responsive web UIs as deployable web applications and supports future UI upgrades of the initial web application by using customizable templates and metadata from which the deployable web application is generated.

For more information on how to integrate the Kendo UI<sup>®</sup> Builder by Progress<sup>®</sup> (Kendo UI Builder) into OpenEdge business applications, refer to the [Progress<sup>®</sup> Software Documentation web site](https://documentation.progress.com/index.html#page/progdocindex/kendo-ui-builder-by-progress.html).
