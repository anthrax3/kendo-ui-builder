# Styling & Themes Overview

All available themes in the Builder are bundled and ready to use.

Originally, the Kendo UI components that are integrated with AngularJS support more themes than the Kendo UI components for Angular do. To keep the parity between the two frameworks, the lacking themes for Angular were generated with the [Kendo UI Theme Builder]().  

The following table lists the support of each theme by the Kendo UI widgets for jQuery, which provide the integration with AngularJS, and by the Kendo UI components for Angular.
