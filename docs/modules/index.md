# Modules Overview

Modules are the building blocks of your application.

They represent a single business function, such as order entry or inventory, which are then packaged into a single application. One module that contains a customizable log in screen and a landing page is provided for you at the time of creating the application.

For more information, refer to the tutorial on [how to add and edit modules]({% slug editmodules_tutorials_kuib %}).
