# Modules Overview

Modules represent the functional units of the web application and are collections of views.

By default, the Builder provides a built-in App Module for each application once it is created. For more information, refer to the article on the [App Module]({% slug appmodule_kuib %}).

Depending on the requirements of your project, you can create additional modules and add one or more views to each of them.
