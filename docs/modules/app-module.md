# Application Module

The Builder adds an App Module each time you create a new application.

The App Module contains the built-in [App Layout]({% slug applayout_kuib %}), [Landing Page]({% slug landingpage_kuib %}), [Login]({% slug login_kuib %}), and [Unauthorized Page]({% slug unauthorized_kuib %}) system views.

> The App Module cannot be deleted and does not provide options for setting user roles.
