Preview runs the latest generation of the web app. If the app has not yet been generated, or requires generation after editing in the Designer, this option automatically generates the app before previewing it.
* Publish, which generates a deployment image of the HTML and JavaScript source code for the app based on the latest edits, using one of the following deployment options that you choose:
