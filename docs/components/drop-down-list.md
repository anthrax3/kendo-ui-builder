# Drop Down List

Drop Down Lists let users choose a single predefined value from a list.

You can relate the Drop Down List as a parent-child pair to support cascading. The cascading Drop Down List is a series of two or more Drop Down Lists where each Drop Down List is filtered based on the selected option in the previous Drop Down List.
