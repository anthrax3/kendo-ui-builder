# DropDownList

DropDownLists let users choose a single predefined value from a list.

You can relate the DropDownList as a parent-child pair to support cascading. The cascading DropDownList is a series of two or more DropDownLists where each DropDownList is filtered based on the selected option in the previous DropDownList.
