# Components Overview

The components represent the widgets that will be rendered by the application.

They are part of the [Blank view]({% slug customviews_kuib %}) and you can add them to your project only when you work with that custom view. The Builder supports two types of components&mdash;built-in and ready-to-use, and [custom]({% slug customcomp_kuib %}). The built-in components are either native Kendo UI components for Angular or integrated with AngularJS, or are generally inspired by the Kendo UI suites.

The built-in components are grouped into the following categories:

* [Charts]({% slug chartscomp_kuib %})       
* [Data management]({% slug datamanagementcomp_kuib %})        
* [Editors]({% slug editorscomp_kuib %})
* [Layout]({% slug layoutcomp_kuib %})       
* [Media]({% slug mediacomp_kuib %})
* [Navigation]({% slug navigationcomp_kuib %})
* [Schedulers]({% slug schedulerscomp_kuib %})
