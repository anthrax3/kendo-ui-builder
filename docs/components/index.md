# Components Overview

The components are part of the custom Blank view of the Builder.

The Builder supports built-in components that are ready to use and also enables you to create and implement custom components in your project.

## Built-In

The built-in components are either native Kendo UI components for Angular or AngularJS, or are generally inspired by the Kendo UI suites. To add a built-in component, drag-and-drop it to the desired location in the current view.

For an easy retrieval, the built-in components are split into the following categories:
* Charts       
* Data management        
* Editors        
* Media        
* Navigation        
* Schedulers        
* Layout
