# Extending Styles

## View Styles

When you create a view, the Builder generates a custom `.css` file in which you can define specific styles for that view and edit them through the **Edit CSS** button. To use the view styles, define the CSS classes for the view by utilizing the `list` CSS class property.

## Themes

The Builder enables you to import custom theme s that are created through the Import custom theme from the [Kendo UI ThemeBuilder](http://themebuilder.telerik.com/kendo-ui).
