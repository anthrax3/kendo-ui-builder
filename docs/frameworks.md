# Frameworks

The Builder enables you to implement [native Kendo UI for Angular components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/) and [Kendo UI for jQuery widgets which are integrated with AngularJS](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/AngularJS/introduction).

For both frameworks, you can implement the components in the Blank view only. However, the properties and functionalities of the components which are supported by the Builder might not fully correspond to the properties and functionalities of the components for Angular or of the AngularJS-integrated widgets. More framework-specific information is included in each topic which presents a feature that is affected by or implemented differently in each framework.

The Builder supports:
* Angular version 5 or later
* AngularJS version 1.6 or later

When the Builder generates an Angular application, it transpiles the code in ECMA script 2015 and generates the project together with its configuration for Angular CLI. This means that once generated, you can readily use and further develop the application directly in the Angular framework without need of the Builder.
