For both frameworks, you can implement Kendo UI components in the Blank view. However, the features and functionalities of the Kendo UI components which are supported by the Builder might not fully correspond to the features and functionalities of the Kendo UI components for Angular or of the AngularJS-integrated Kendo UI widgets for jQuery.
